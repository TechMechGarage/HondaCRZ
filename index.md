# Honda CRZ

Welcome to the project site for my Honda CRZ.

I have recently (Sept 2019) added a CRZ to my garage. 
It has 65k miles, but one major down side, it has some front end accident damage!

I am attempting to repair the car (mostly) myself.
My mechanical experience is limited.
I have changed car light bulbs, but never so much as an oil change, and nothing as extensive as accident damage. 

So this is going to be an interesting journey for me. I hope to learn a lot, and have a nicely modified CRZ by the end.


This site contains information on:

* [Crash Damage Repair (on going since Sep 2019)](./CrashDamageRepair)
* [Custom Modifications](./CustomModifications)
* [Maintenance](./Maintenance) 
* [Tool Box](./ToolBox)

Some ways to get [in touch with me](./Contact).
