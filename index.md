# Honda CRZ

Welcome to the project site for my Honda CRZ.

I have recently (Sept 2019) added a CRZ to my garage ([Spec and Previous History](./History)).
It has 65k miles, but one major down side, it has some front end accident damage!
(prompting the previous owner to sell)

I am attempting to repair the car (mostly) myself.
My mechanical experience is very limited.
My experience is limited to changing headlight bulbs, I have never so much as done oil change, 
and nothing as extensive as accident damage. 

So this is going to be an interesting journey for me. I hope to learn a lot, 
and have a nicely modified custom Honda CRZ by the end.
