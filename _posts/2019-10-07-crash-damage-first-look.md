This is the first look into the crash damage on my Honda CRZ
([which I purchased in Sep 2019](https://techmechgarage.github.io/2019/09/30/welcome-honda-crz.html)).
This post consist of two parts:
(1) my assessment of the crash damage and (2) some initial quotes I got from local body shops.


### Crash Damage Assessment

In order to assess the damage, I basically conducted a visual inspection and listed 
the parts of the car which I think need to be repaired.
At this stage, I have not removed any parts from the car, I am just looking to
conduct and preliminary inspection.



List of damage and potential fixes:

* Bonnet alignment. 
Heat up bonnet hinges, and pull into correct place. Need to remove wind screen wiper cover to gain full access to hinges.

* Front bumper repair
  * Two part repair
    * (1) The main bumper has multiple spots of damage,
    * (2) also the centre gill is damaged.
  * Main repair will involve bonding broken part together.
  * Needs under tray and scoops molding back into shape.
  * Needs air intake molding in shape

  * Front under tray is damage causing much lower ground clearance.
  Needs further investigation


* Air conditioning condenser.
Needs further investigation.

* Front crash bar need replacing.
(currently investigating if I can use a crash bar from another honda vehicle, as CRZ parts are not very common.
