Today I am welcoming a 2010 Honda CRZ into my garage.
Here is more information about the [specs and previous history](https://techmechgarage.github.io/HondaCRZ/History/).


I purchased this car in Sept 2019.
It has 65k miles, but one major down side, it has some front end accident damage!

I am attempting to repair the car myself.
My mechanical experience is very limited, I have changing headlight bulbs, 
but never so much as an oil change, 
and nothing as extensive as accident damage. 

So this is going to be an interesting journey for me. I hope to learn a lot, 
and have a nicely modified custom Honda CRZ by the end.


I have also way been a fan of modified cars, ever since I was a child.
This is my first chance of owning a car which I can modify and build into 
my very own modified custom car.

I am going to be using this site to document the progress I am making.


Go to next post and read about my
[first look at the crash damage](https://techmechgarage.github.io/2019/10/07/crash-damage-first-look.html).
