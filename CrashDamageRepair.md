# Crash Damage Repair

This pages lists information on the crash damage repair I am attmeping to fix on my Honda CRZ
(on going since Oct 2019).



List of damage and potential fixes:

* Bonnet alignment. 
Heat up bonnet hinges, and pull into correct place. Need to remove wind screen wiper cover to gain full access to hinges.

* Front bumper repair
  * Two part repair
    * (1) The main bumper has multiple spots of damage,
    * (2) also the centre gill is damaged.
  * Main repair will involve bonding broken part together.
  * Needs under tray and scoops molding back into shape.
  * Needs air intake molding in shape

  * Front under tray is damage causing much lower ground clearance.
  Needs further investigation


* Air conditioning condenser.
Needs further investigation.

* Front crash bar need replacing.
(currently investigating if I can use a crash bar from another honda vehicle, as CRZ parts are not very common.
