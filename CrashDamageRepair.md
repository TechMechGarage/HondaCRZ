# Crash Damage Repair

This pages lists information on the crash damage repair I am attempting to fix on my Honda CRZ
(on going since Oct 2019).



#### Cost so far...

| Date | Item  | Why? | Who? | Cost | 
|:-----|:------|:-----|:------|:-----|
|  |  |  |  |  | 
| Oct 2019 | 20pcs plastic bumper clips | To reattach front bumper, broke most of them on bumper removal (Ended up being wrong size). | AliExpress | ~£1.41 ($1.83) |
| Oct 2019 | 20pcs screw plastic bumper clips | As above, figure the screw type might be better (Ended up being wrong size). | AliExpress | ~£0.65 ($0.84) |
|  |  |  |  |  | 

|  |  |  |  | Total: £2.06 ($2.67) |
